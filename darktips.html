					<h2>Here's our complete list of tips and tricks to help you!</h2>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li><h2>Coat things like fruit and chocolate chips in flour before adding them to your mix. This prevents all the bits from sinking to the bottom and ensures you’ve got an even distribution of flavour</h2></li>
						<li><h2>When measuring flours, don’t scoop with your measuring cup. Spoon flour into your measuring cup and level it with a knife</h2></li>
						<li><h2>Always let your cakes cool before attempting to ice them. They’ll break if you take them out the tin too early and the frosting will melt right off. Basically, let those babies rest for a good 30 minutes before attempting anything</h2></li>
						<li><h2>Know that a lot of the time, you shoudn't over-mix things. Very rarely should you ever mix a dough or batter until all of the lumps are gone. Most recipes say “until incorporated” and they mean just that</h2></li>
						<li><h2>Bang your cake pans on the counter a few times before putting them in the oven. It will get the big air bubbles out of the batter</h2></li>
						<li><h2>Test your cakes with a toothpick to check if they're done. If pieces stick to the toothpick, it’s not ready yet! Better to set a timer for less than what the recipe says and have to wait a few more minutes than risk over baking and turning everything dry and sad</h2></li>
						<li><h2>Use the same weight of eggs, flour, sugar, and butter for a perfect sponge cake. When making a sponge cake, weigh your eggs and then use that same weight of flour, sugar, and butter</h2></li>
					</ul>
